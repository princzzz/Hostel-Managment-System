# Hostel-Managment-System

The Hostel Management system is a web application that enables students
to lodge their request for room cleaning, food quality complaint, apply for
waiver, can view monthly mess fees and provide any suggestion needed
online. Also the warden can accept the application of the students, view
the application forms, reject the fake applications, view the complaints in
the hostel, accept the fee and medical waiver application and update mess
fees.
